This gem is the simplest thing that could possibly work that
reads the output of [exiftool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool)
and renders it into a ruby hash, with *correctly typed values* and symbolized keys.

Ruby 2.6 through 3.0 are supported.

##  Ruby Support Deprecation Notice

Starting March 31, 2021 future releases of `exiftool` Gem will no longer support following
Ruby Versions due to their [End Of Life](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/) announcements:
- Ruby 2.4 (EOL 2020-03-31)
- Ruby 2.5 (EOL 2021-03-31)

The latest Exiftool is recommended, but you'll get that automatically by using the
[exiftool_vendored](https://github.com/exiftool-rb/exiftool_vendored.rb) gem!

## Features

* Multiget support
* GPS latitude and longitude values are parsed as signed floats,
  where north and east are positive, and west and south are negative.
* Values like shutter speed and exposure time are rendered as Rationals,
  which lets the caller show them as fractions (1/250) or as comparable numeric instances.
* String values like "interop" and "serial number" are kept as strings
  (which preserves zero prefixes)
* Timestamps are attempted to be interpreted with correct timezones and sub-second resolution, if
  the header contains that data.
  If the timestamp doesn't include a timezone offset, we leave it as a string, rather than inferring
  the current system timezone which might not be applicable to the image. We add a decimal yyyymmdd
  key for these problematic fields.
* No ```method_missing``` madness
* Excellent test coverage
* Clean, readable code
* MIT license

## Usage

```ruby
require 'exiftool'
e = Exiftool.new("path/to/iPhone 4S.jpg")
e.to_hash
# => {:make => "Apple", :gps_longitude => -122.47566667, …
e.to_display_hash
# => {"Make" => "Apple", "GPS Longitude" => -122.47566667, …
```

### Multiget support

This gem supports Exiftool's multiget, which lets you fetch metadata for many files at once.

This can be dramatically more efficient than spinning up the ```exiftool```
process for each file due to the cost of spinning up perl.

Supply an array to the Exiftool initializer, then use ```.result_for```:

```ruby
require 'exiftool'
e = Exiftool.new(Dir["**/*.jpg"])
result = e.result_for("path/to/iPhone 4S.jpg")
result.to_hash
# => {:make => "Apple", :gps_longitude => -122.47566667, …
result[:gps_longitude]
# => -122.47566667
```

Or iterate through files_with_results:

```ruby
e.files_with_results
# => ["path/to/iPhone 4S.jpg", "path/to/Droid X.jpg", …
```

### Dates without timezones

It seems that most exif dates don't include timezone offsets, without which forces us to assume the
current timezone is applicable to the image, which isn't necessarily correct.

To be correct, we punt and return the exiftool-formatted string, which will be something like
```%Y:%m:%d %H:%M:%S```.

If the clock was set correctly on your camera, the date will be the correct calendar day
as far as you were concerned when you took the photo. Given that, we
add a ```_civil``` key associated to just the calendar date of the field, which should be safe-ish.

```ruby
require 'exiftool'
e = Exiftool.new("test/IMG_2452.jpg")
e[:date_time_original]
=> "2011:07:06 09:46:45"
e[:date_time_original_civil]
=> #<Date: 2011-07-06 ((2455749j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
```

### When things go wrong

* ```Exiftool::NoSuchFile``` is raised if the provided filename doesn't exist.
* ```Exiftool::ExiftoolNotInstalled``` is raised if ```exiftool``` isn't in your ```PATH```.
* If ExifTool has a problem reading EXIF data, no exception is raised, but ```#errors?``` will return true:

```ruby
Exiftool.new("Gemfile").errors?
#=> true
```

## Installation

### Step 1: Install ExifTool

The easiest way is to use the "vendored" exiftool in the
[exiftool_vendored](https://github.com/exiftool-rb/exiftool_vendored.rb) gem. Just add

    gem 'exiftool_vendored'

to your Gemfile, run ```bundle```, and you're done. (Note that it depends on the ```exiftool``` gem,
so really, you're done! Skip step 2!)

If you want to install exiftool on your system yourself:

* MacOS with [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/)? ```brew install exiftool```
* Debian or Ubuntu? ```sudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl```
* Something else? [RTFM](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/install.html)!

### Step 2: Add the gem

If you didn't use ```exiftool_vendored```, then add this your Gemfile:

    gem 'exiftool'

and then run ```bundle```.

If you have exiftool installed outside of ruby's ```PATH```, add an initializer that points the gem
to the tool, like this: ```Exiftool.command = '/home/ruby/Image-ExifTool-9.33/exiftool'```. You don't need to do
this if you've installed added the exiftool directory to the PATH of the shell that runs ruby.
